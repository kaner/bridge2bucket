The Python script bridge2bucket.py dumps bridges from the Tor BridgeDB database
file into file buckets. It is a workaround solution until we have rewritten the
BridgeDB bucket feature.

The Python script sendBridgesFromBuckets.py reads in a configured number of
bucket files and sends the bridges out to configured email addresses.
