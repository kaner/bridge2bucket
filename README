This is a collection of scripts that enable its users to send off unallocated
Tor Bridges to users. Currently, the only way to send Bridges is by email.

The original repository can be found at:

    https://github.com/kaner/bridge2bucket

The Python script bridge2bucket.py dumps bridges from the Tor BridgeDB database
file into file buckets. It is a workaround solution until we have rewritten the
BridgeDB bucket feature.

The Python script sendBridgesFromBuckets.py reads in a configured number of
bucket files and sends the bridges out to configured email addresses.
